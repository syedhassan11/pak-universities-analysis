# pak-universities-analysis
Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of universities in Pakistan using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The aim is to analyze key aspects like the number of universities by province, type (public/private), and to visualize trends to help students, researchers, and policymakers better understand the higher education landscape in Pakistan.

This project demonstrates data cleaning, manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization, making it a great showcase for Python and data analysis skills.
